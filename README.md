# Hypnos - A Hyperdimensional Computing Based Wake-up Circuit
Hypnos has the purpose to act as a smart wake-up circuit within larger SoCs. It
consists of an SPI master module, a lightweight general purpose digital
preprocessing block and an autonomous hardware accelerator for hyperdimensional
computing. The basic idea of this piece of hardware is to detect events of
interest within a continuous stream of digital data from external sensors
attached via SPI and trigger the wake-up line of an attached power management
module to wake up more powerfull and energy hungrier hardware.

The documentation of this module is still in its very early stage. More
information about hypnos' internals and the programming scheme for smart wake up
operation will follow.
